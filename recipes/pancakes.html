	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>1 cup whole wheat flour</li>
		<li>2/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
		<li>1/3 cup wheat germ</li>
		<li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
		<li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
		<li>5 1/3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
		<li>2 1/2 cups buttermilk</li>
		<li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
		<li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Steps</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>In a large bowl, combine the whole wheat flour, white flour, 
		wheat germ, baking powder, baking soda, brown sugar, and salt.</li>
		<li>Cut the butter into small pieces with a knife, and add the 
		butter to the flour-mixture. Mix until the mixture has a 
		sand-like consistency.</li>
		<li>Make a well in the center of the flour-butter mixture, 
		and add the buttermilk and eggs. Stir until the liquids 
		are fully incorporated.</li>
		<li>Heat a frying pan over medium heat and grease the surface 
		with 1 tablespoon of butter or oil. Ladle the batter onto 
		the surface to form 4 inch pancakes. Once bubbles form on

		the other side for about 2 minutes.</li>
